# PebbleImages
Watchface for Pebble which loads images from internet - this is the watchface branch

This project uses the image loading libraries from the awesome [PebbleFaces Project](https://github.com/pebble-examples/pebble-faces). Thanks so much to those who set up this sample library - it works great!
